# \*Beginner: QuadFusion Assembly

This guide will cover the inner workings of the QuadFusion. There will be a significant amount of technical knowledge and terms throughout these guides that will reference what is explained here. The different assemblies of the QuadFusion will be mentioned frequently in the sections below.

Inside the QuadFusion:

* **QuadFusion Head**: The head of the Quad is designed to fit four filaments. The way it works is by having two channels on either side of the head. These channels guide the filament down the QuadFusion in order to be extruded
* **Gears**: The QuadFusion has four gears controlled by four motors. When the filament is loaded into the QuadFusion, it encounters the gears which will turn and latch on to the filament, pulling it through. 
* **Set-screw**: There are two set-screws with bearings placed upon them. The purpose of these is to help keep the filament in its channel as it passes through the QuadFusion.

The Nozzle:

* **Teflon Tube**: Once the filament has traveled down its designated channel, it will encounter the teflon tube that sits inside the nozzle. The tube is divided into four sections, one for each of the filaments you will be loading.

* **Mixing Chamber**: Once the filaments have all passed into their section of the teflon tube, they will travel down into the mixing chamber. The mixing chamber lies at the very tip of the nozzle, this is where your filaments will mix in order to give you the color you requested.
