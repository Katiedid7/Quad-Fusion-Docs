## Contributing

The main way to collaborate to the guides is to become a collaborator.  But sometimes you simply want to submit a small contribution, without becoming a regular collaborator.

On GitHub, one can use the popular _Pull Request_ feature.  To do so, you would clone [https://github.com/PrintM3D/Quad-Fusion-Docs](https://github.com/PrintM3D/Quad-Fusion-Docs), make changes on your own copy, and submit back your changes by submitting a _Pull Request_ to M3D.  Then we will review the changes accordingly.

Thank you!
