### Mechanically

The Prusa i3 MK2S requires an entirely new extruder mount in order to mount the QuadFusion. The new mount is very similar to the old, a few things were just shifted to accommodate for the new fan mounts.

You will need...  
- 3mm Hex Standoffs \(20mm long\) \(x2\)  
- 3mm Hex Screw \(33mm long\) \(x2\)  
- 8mm Nut \(3mm thick\) \(x2\)  
- QuadFusion Mount  
- Zip-ties \(x6\)

Tools...  
- 2.5mm Hex Screwdriver

As you can see, the front of the mount has two sets of holes, the bottom set is where you will be screwing in the two 3mm standoffs.

The back of the mount shows where it will be mounted to the Prusa. The lower X-belt will lie across the ledge of the mount. While the upper X-belt will be wrapped around the two protruding cylinders. You can tighten the X-belt by wrapping more of the belt around the cylinder, as shown in the picture above.   
Additionally, the mount is attached to the Prusa using six zip-ties. Theses zip-ties can be routed through designated holes that the mount contains.
