# ABS-R Success Guide

Follow this step by step guide for successful printing with ABS-R.

## Material Table

|  | First Layer | Printing |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| Bed Temperature | 70째C | 60째C |
| Nozzle Temperature | 220째C | 235째C |
| Retraction Distance | - | - |
| Retraction Speed | - | - |

## Preparation

Follow the [Preparing a Print](https://m3d.gitbook.io/promega-docs/getting-started/preparing-a-print) guide for more help on slicing a print. Incorporate the material settings above into printing and bed temperature.

## Guide

1. Heat the bed up to ABS-R first layer temperature
2. Once the bed is hot, probe the bed with `G30` and then level the bed with `G29 S0`. Follow the [Bed Leveling & Probing](https://m3d.gitbook.io/promega-docs/repair-guides/repairing-broken-belt-clamps#leveling-the-bed) guide if you need help.
3. Heat up the nozzle to printing temperature and load filament. Follow the [Loading and Unloading Filament](https://m3d.gitbook.io/promega-docs/getting-started/loading-and-unloading-filament#loading-filament) guide. It is best to extruder about 10  mm of filament to make sure filament is flowing through correctly. Remember to clear the extruded filament with tweezers before starting the print.
4. Upload the print to the board. For more help follow the [Running a Print](https://m3d.gitbook.io/promega-docs/getting-started/running-a-print) guide.

## Quality Troubleshooting

Read the section below to improve the quality of your ABS-R print. The titles of the section below indicate the problems that you might see when printing ABS-R and how to solve them.

**Blobbing**

Blobbing can look like what is circled on the picture below:

Blobbing can have a few causes. The reason blobbing occurs is because the nozzle suddenly extrudes more than usual, thus creating a "blob" in the print. One of the causes of this can be back pressure, which is more of a concern with the Quad Fusion. Since there are four filaments being loaded into the Quad Fusion, if they are not all in line some back pressure may occur. Thus, when you retract one of the four filaments the other three will still be experiencing pressure and may ooze out of the nozzle.  
Another cause for blobbing can be \_\_\_\_\_\_

Solution:  
While blobbing may occur for many reasons, it can be prevented with many more. For starters, make sure when you're loading your filaments that they are all in line. This has been explained in [Loading and Unloading Filament](../getting-started/loading-and-unloading-filament.md).   
Another solution is to edit your slicer settings, by including the ability to retract the filament for each new layer your print is less likely to contain blobs. 

**Stringing**

Stringing can look like this:

**Under-extrusion**

Under-extrusion can look like this:
