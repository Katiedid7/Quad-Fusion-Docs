# Mounting the Hardware

The QuadFusion is a versatile 3D print head, so it is very likely that it will be able to adapt to whatever printer you have at home. At M3D we have mounted the QuadFusion on many different types of printers. The following guide will show you how we mounted the QuadFusion's hardware on each of those printers. 

## Fan Mounts

The first thing that must be understood is that based on the printer you have, you may need a certain type of fan mount. The fan mounts on the ProMega will be different than those on the Crane, and those on the CR-10S. So, we will also be providing the \(\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\) for these fan mounts to help you properly attach your QuadFusion to your printer.
