description: Mounting your QuadFusion 3D Print Head

# \*Mounting the Hardware

The QuadFusion is a versatile 3D print head, so it is very likely that it will be able to adapt to whatever printer you have at home. At M3D we have mounted the QuadFusion on many different types of printers. The following guide will show you how we mounted the QuadFusion's hardware on each of those printers. 

## Fan Mounts

{% hint style="warning" %}
The MakerBot Replicator 2X does not use any of these fan mounts, go straight to [MakerBot Replicator 2X](network-setup.md#makerbot-replicator-2x) if this applies to you.
{% endhint %}

The first thing that must be understood is that based on the printer you have, you may need a certain type of fan mount. The fan mounts on the ProMega will be different than those on the Crane, and those on the CR-10S. So, we will also be providing the \(\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\) for these fan mounts to help you properly attach your QuadFusion to your printer.

**Types of Fan Mounts:**

Crane Fan Mount



ProMega Fan Mount



Basic Fan Mount

You will need...  
- 12V fan \(x2\) **\(Look at the picture below to make sure you have the correct type of fan\)**  
- 24V fan \(x1\)  
- 2mm Torx screw \(\_\_\_\_\) \(x4\)  
- 3mm Cone-Head Torx screw \(12mm long\) \(x2\)  
- Fan Mount  
- Fan Ducts 

Tools...  
- T-10 Torx Screwdriver  
- T-6 Torx Screwdriver

**How To Attach:**

With the first fan mount, line the hole up with the nut inside the side slot of the QuadFusion. Make sure the mount is in the proper orientation, the prongs should be facing the front of the QuadFusion.

Using the Cone-Head Screw, attach the mount to the QuadFusion:

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2859%29.png)

Repeat with the other side of the Quad Fusion.

Next, take the side fan and the fan duct and insert the duct into the fan's slot. 

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2825%29.png)

The duct's open end should be facing the back of the fan.  

Then, insert the two 2mm Torx screws into the fan and duct's holes. Afterwards, slide the fan with the duct into the fan mount:

Position the fan so that the holes in the mount line up with the screws keeping the duct connected to the fan. 

## Printers:

M3D Crane  
M3D ProMega  
Prusa i3 MK2S  
CR-10S  
MakerBot Replicator 2X



### Prusa i3 MK2S

The Prusa i3 MK2S requires an entirely new extruder mount in order to mount the QuadFusion. The new mount is very similar to the old, a few things were just shifted to accommodate for the new fan mounts.

![](../.gitbook/assets/img_1390.jpg)

You will need...  
- 3mm Hex Standoffs \(20mm long\) \(x2\)  
- 3mm Hex screw \(33mm long\) \(x2\)  
- 8mm nut \(3mm thick\) \(x2\)  
- QuadFusion Mount  
- Zip-ties \(x6\)

Tools...  
- 2.5mm Hex Screwdriver

![Front](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2856%29.png)

As you can see, the front of the mount has two sets of holes, the bottom set is where you will be screwing in the two 3mm standoffs.

![Back](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2819%29.png)

The back of the mount shows where it will be mounted to the Prusa. The lower X-belt will lie across the ledge of the mount. While the upper X-belt will be wrapped around the two protruding cylinders. You can tighten the X-belt by wrapping more of the belt around the cylinder, as shown in the picture above.   
Additionally, the mount is attached to the Prusa using six zip-ties. Theses zip-ties can be routed through designated holes that the mount contains.

### CR-10S













### MakerBot Replicator 2X

{% hint style="warning" %}
This mount does not have a nozzle cooling fan. Be cautious of the side effects of not cooling your nozzle.
{% endhint %}

This printer does not have a fan mount design, instead four standoffs were used to attach two 24V fans to the back of the QuadFusion. See below:

PICTURE!

Once you have attached the fans you can move one to mounting the QuadFusion.

### M3D Crane

Once you have attached the designated fan mount, you can now attach the QuadFusion. 

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2847%29.png)

You will need...  
- 3mm standoffs \(25mm long\) \(x2\)  
- 3mm Torx Screws \(10mm long\) \(x2\)

Tools...  
- 3mm Hex Screwdriver  
- \_\_\_\_\_ Hex Screwdriver  
- Pliers

The back of your existing extruder's mount should look like this:

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2845%29.png)

Using the 3mm Hex Screwdriver and Pliers, undo the circled wheel.

Attach the two standoffs to to QuadFusion:

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2849%29.png)

Now, using the two \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ hex screws, attach the QuadFusion to the mount:

![](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2832%29.png)

Once you have done this, you can reattach the bottom wheel.
