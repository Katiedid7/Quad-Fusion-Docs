# Getting Connected

This page is a generic overview of what you'll need to do to connect your QuadFusion mechanically and electrically. See the bottom of the page for links to pages with details on more specific printers.



### Connecting Mechanically















### Connecting Electrically

This is the QuadFusion without fans:

As you can see there are four motor wires, one heater wire, and a PT1000 wire.

**Given Cables** 

The cables that are provided with the QuadFusion are these:

These are the wires that connect to the motors. Each small white end will connect to the motors' connector:

In the end, you should have one cable for each motor:

**Not Given** 

The remaining cables that will need extensions are the heater and PT1000. Both require the same connector, a 2-pin male Molex, that will look like this:

The opposite end of this wire can be either a 2-pin female Molex connector:

Or, a 2-pin female Dupont connector:

The final result,

The length of these wires is entirely based upon the printer you are using. The wires in the picture below are for example only.

Now that you have the necessary wires for each of the motors, the heater, and PT1000, you can move on to other guides. 

If you are connecting to the Duet Maestro, continue on to the [Duet Maestro Wiring](../electrical-guides/duet-maestro-wiring.md) guide to connect the QuadFusion to your printer.
