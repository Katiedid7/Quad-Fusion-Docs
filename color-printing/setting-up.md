# Setting Up

In order to print with the QuadFusion you'll need a plugin on Cura called MELT. MELT is helpful for individual layer printing and gradient printing. This guide will assume you have already installed Cura. 



**Instructions for downloading MELT:**

Go to: [https://github.com/gargansa/MELT](https://github.com/gargansa/MELT)  
Click “Download Zip”

Once you have downloaded the Zip file, go to your Local Disk → Program Files → Ultimaker Cura 3.3 → Plugins → Post Processing Plugin → Scripts

Once in scripts, copy the MELT.py file, from when you downloaded MELT, into this folder. You should now be able to use MELT when using Cura
